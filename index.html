            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Feminist movements have become increasingly popular and visible in China during last two decades, with waves of women’s agitations flood popular media, especially the Internet.
                In quick succession, such outcries have drawn much international attention to what some see as a "Chinese feminist awakening." Yet, as systematic oppression and violence persist and intertwine, neither the depoliticized gendered popular culture nor the single-issue 
                feminist advocacy and resistance can overturn the unequal power structures.</p>

                "What dilemmas does contemporary Chinese feminism face in social practice, considering its complex and intersectional background of China's rapid economic development, technological advancement, traditional cultural values, and state control?"
            </div>
            
            <p>This is the central question that guides my exploration on Chinese feminism in the 21st Century. In this multimodal composition, I will begin with a brief history of feminism in contemporary China. Following it I will divide the dilemmas of 21st-century Chinese feminist movements 
                into four areas and respectively discuss them: anti-feminism and misogyny, party-state control, entrepreneurial <span class="tooltip">C-fem<span class="tooltiptext">A concept introduced in Wu and Dong's essay (2019), which is short for "made-in-China feminism" (p.4) and differentiates from the Western feminism.</span></span>, and marginalization of disadvantaged women. At the end I will conclude the common characteristics of the dilemmas and identify possible future improvements for this essay.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context: From State Feminism to Grassroots Movements</h2>
            
            <p>To understand 21st-century feminism in China, it's always necessary to first examine the historical foundations. Unlike Western feminism, which emerged largely as a grassroots movement against patriarchal structures, Chinese feminism was initially shaped by state policies aimed at mobilizing women as part of broader political and economic goals.</p>
            
            <h3>State Feminism Era: the "Iron Girls"</h3>
            
            <p>Under Mao Zedong's leadership (1949-1976), China promoted a form of state feminism encapsulated in his famous saying: "Women hold up half the sky." This era saw the promotion of gender equality through labor participation, with the "Iron Girls" representing the ideal of women's capability to perform traditionally male work. However, this state-sponsored equality often neglected the double burden women faced, as they were expected to fulfill both productive and reproductive roles.</p>
            
            <h3>Reform Era: the Resurgence of Gender Discrimination</h3>
            
            <p>The economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s brought new challenges. As China transitioned to a market economy, many of the protective policies for women's employment were undermined. Discrimination in hiring, promotion, and pay became more pronounced, while traditional gender norms resurfaced. The 1995 UN World Conference on Women held in Beijing marked a turning point, connecting Chinese women's rights advocates with global feminist movements and ideas, helping spark feminist research and gaving rise to grassroots activism in the next century.</p>
            
            <h3>21st-century: Bottom-up, Grassroots, and Detachment from the State</h3>
            
            <p>The early 21st century witnessed the emergence of a more diverse feminist landscape in China. With increasing access to higher education and global information flows, young urban women began questioning gender norms and discriminatory practices. The internet provided crucial space for feminist discussions outside traditional state-controlled women's organizations. However, due to the State's repression of unofficial feminist organizations, the feminist movement in recent years has become more of an apolitical cultural form of ideological dissemination.</p>

            <p>In 2020, the catchphrase "普信" (average-yet-confident) went viral online in China.

            </div>
              
            
            <p>Soon after, on social media, she was accused of "sexism," "man hating," and "provoking antagonism between men and women," and was reported to the National Radio and Television Administration for promoting "sexist" speech. More concerningly, her social media pages were flooded with insults and threats.</p>

            <p>This incident indicates that while social media provides women and feminists with a space for collective emotional and political expression, anti-feminism and misogyny have also become more acute in such spaces. According Yin's research (2019), she discussed four strategies that are used by anti-feminists and misogynists to demonise feminists and delegitimise feminism online:</p>

            <h3>Identifying feminists as deviant women</h3>

            <p>The most common form of online abuse directed at women feminists involved criticising their appearance, marital status and personality. For example, the following comment was made on an influential grassroots feminist account:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                Judging from the women I personally know, no women who call themselves feminists have good looks, have a good personality or receive love from men. Feminists are pathetic. They are all ugly and do not enjoy any gender privileges. Feminism is good because it shows who female losers are. (February 28 2016, 03:19)
            </div>

            <p>This apparently "banal" but powerful way of demonising feminists—portraying them as deviant women who are not liked by men or are somehow "not women" – is common worldwide. Identifying feminists as "unattractive" is a common sentiment within anti-feminist humour and works to "bolster claims of irrationality" attributed to feminists.</p>

            <p><span class="tooltip">E-bile<span class="tooltiptext">Same as "electronic bile." A term coined by scholar Emma A. Jane to describe online messages targeting women that often include misogynistic slurs, threats of sexual violence, and are rooted in broader patterns of digital misogyny.</span></span>—although circulated in a new medium—merely perpetuates an attitude "with a far older tradition—one which insists that women are inferior.” By side-lining and repelling women who do not follow patriarchal rules, this strategy operates as an attempt to eliminate male’s anxiety engendered by class inequality in the post-socialist transition and re-stabilizes the male-dominant hegemony in cultural changes.</p>

            <h3>Identifying feminists as betraying the nation</h3>

            <p>By characterising feminists as obeying the demands of Western anti-China forces (also called "external hostile forces") against China’s renaissance, one anti-feminist (female) posted:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                I hope that all sisters will stay clear-headed and not be instigated by the so-called "feminism" and become a weapon against our government used by some anti-China forces to incite domestic struggles (January 31 2019, 19:31)
            </div>

            <p>Many prior studies demonstrate that the "Western-rooted" characteristic of feminism is constructed by anti-feminists as an imaginary threat to traditional Chinese moral values and culture, especially when China’s renaissance has been prioritised in the government’s political agenda. This strategy legitimises anti-feminist acts as resisting"imported goods" and forms of neo-colonialism, concealing the underlying political and economic contradictions in society and transferring the blame for structural inequality and systemic injustice onto (feminist) women.</p>

            <p>Such xenophobia is, in fact, a manifestation of deep prejudice that demands unquestioning submission to the authority of patriarchy (with women being made nothing more than a resource) and which is intolerant of any deviation from strict rules of conduct (gendered, patriarchal norms). In this sense, the amplification of the ideological Chinese-Western binary is an effective strategy to circulate and reproduce anti-feminist discourse aimed at suppressing feminism.</p>
    
            <h3>Identifying feminists as connected to Islamists</h3>

            <p>The third main strategy in which anti-feminists stigmatise feminism is by linking feminists with Islam and using Islamophobia to stir up public panic about feminists and feminist organisations. For instance, in 2017, an influential feminist account commented on a post about the consequences of divorce for Arab Muslim women, including being stoned to death by their ex-husband’s relatives, or having their faces disfigured to stop them remarrying. The feminist account argued that the punishment of stoning is in fact, usually used in cases of blasphemy, homosexuality, and adultery, but not in all divorce cases. Notwithstanding the account holder’s attempt to offer further clarification regarding the claims made in the original post, the comment was been interpreted as the feminist account denying that divorced women may be stoned as a punishment, and as defending the brutal treatment of Muslim women in Saudi Arabia. A screenshot of the comments, like a rock thrown into water, provoked a wave of criticism:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                Chinese feminists are so powerful, why don’t you go to the Middle East to save Muslim women? (May 18 2017, 21:41)
            </div>
            <div class="quote">
                Feminism has gone to the opposite side of the initial feminist movement, and become a hate organisation that plagues normal social order and keeps bullying men. Feminists only bully the civilised men in civilised society. They never speak for the women who have no human rights in the barbaric and backward Islamic countries, and don’t even dare to confront the barbaric Muslim men who do not respect women. (February 23 2018, 10:05)
            </div>

            <p>These posts show that anti-feminists assume all Muslim women need to be saved by feminists, and that feminists, instead of liberating Muslim women, only target white or Chinese men. Such logic presents a dualistic framework in which white and Chinese menare considered civilised while Muslim men are assumed to be barbaric. According to this framework, feminists are portrayed in a kind of bullying role, but they don’t dare to oppose hegemonic Muslim men—and are therefore hypocritical. This appears to be related to the Islamophobia that prevails around the world, in which Muslims often become synonymous with terrorism and violence towards women.</p>

            <p>Anti-feminist Islamophobic rhetoric functions to mythologise and demonise feminist organizations by invoking framing moral panics and marginalising "the Other." This, in addition to the nationalist discourse mentioned in the previous section, provides ideological under-girding to substantiate the "danger" of a feminist conspiracy, and subsequently discredit feminism.</p>
                
            <h3>Identifying feminists speaking online as fake-feminists</h3>

            <p>The aforementioned three strategies show how anti-feminists or misogynists are aligned with other groups—such as nationalists, Han supremacists and Islamophobes—to form a loose and polycentric alliance. A fourth strategy has been generated: anti-feminists and misogynists adding prefixes such as "fake," "extreme" and "rustic" to "feminism," constructing two kinds of feminism: "real" and "fake," to distinguish feminists from women who are viewed as "actually" contributing to women’s progress. Data analysis revealed that according to anti-feminists, the "real" feminists who do "progressive" things are figures such as female doctors, entrepreneurs and astronauts. The so-called "fake-feminists" are the "ugly" radicals who oppose national traditions, are in league with Western anti-China forces and Islamists, are only active on social media, and use the "feminist" label to garner unearned advantages. When referring to the "fake-feminists," derogatory terms such as "feminist cancer" and "feminist bitch," and the Chinese homophone <span class="tooltip">"women boxers"<span class="tooltiptext">"女权" (women rights) has the same Chinese pronunciation as "女拳" (women boxing), so "女拳师" (women boxers) becomes one of the most popular stigmatizing tools of anti-feminists on feminists.</span></span> are used to imply they are brutal and beat up men online. For example, the comments on a Weibo video introducing different schools of (Western) feminism included the following:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                To be honest, I’m not against women’s rights. But the feminist cancers on Weibo really bother me. If you talk to them, you will experience online violence. (May 11 2020, 21:04)
            </div>
            <div class="quote">
                We support real feminism, the rustic feminism and extreme feminism must be destroyed.(May 12 2020, 17:03)
            </div>

            <p>These comments lump all feminist ideas online together, as if all urgently need to be suppressed. Yet, studies show that there are many strands of feminism in Chinese online cultures. For example, an entrepreneurial strand (will be discussed later in this essay), which encourages women to capitalise on their own sexual attraction to maximise benefits in the marriage market. This usually leads to Chinese men’s misunderstanding and criticisms of feminist movements while hybridising stands of feminism in anti-feminist discourse furtherhinders discussions of structural gender inequality.</p>

            <p>Moreover, some anti-feminists portray themselves as neutral, objective, and rational—as opposed to online feminists. The data shows their ambivalence: on the one hand, they do not openly endorse gender inequality, perhaps because equality between men and women has the authority of being a fundamental national policy; on the other, in commentary on controversial activism and debates (such as #MeToo) or gender-related news from grassroots feminist accounts, anti-feminist voices are present, loud and clear. What seems to be a contradictory position on the surface, is in fact a subtle way to building collective resistances—being attuned to what people think is reasonable, as well as connecting to cultural norms and particular histories.</p>

            <p>To conclude, this fourth strategy rationalise and adds creditability to an anti-feminist political agenda to reaffirm the authority of patriarchy.</p>

            <h2>Party-State Regulation</h2>
            
            <p>In November 2018, the Ministry of Education released regulations over teachers’ behaviors, and one rule particularly concerns the strict prohibition of teachers’ improper relationships with students or conducting any forms of sexual harassment. On August 27 2018, a civil law proposal was submitted to the National People’s Congress specifying that a victim may request the actor to bear civil liability according to law, and the employer shall take action to prevent and stop sexual harassment in the workplace in case of sexual harassment through words or actions. Although the bill is not yet legislated and it remains to see to what extent such law can be effective preventions, these are incredible accomplishments for Chinese feminist movements by which anti-sexual harassment discourses and agendas are unprecedently legitimized and echoed by the state power.</p>

            <p>The state’s seemingly supportive tone toward the anti-sexual harassment campaign does not mean that the political environment is conducive to feminist movements in China, however.</p>

            <p>The political obstacles that the feminist movements (such as #MeToo) face share commonalities with other bottom-up feminist struggles. The coercive state power is attributed to its intolerance over feminism, particularly its critique of patriarchy, and grassroots social movement, which are the main two characteristics of Chinese feminist movements in the 21st century. The immediate attack on them, unsurprisingly, is censorship—including censoring online discussions and monitoring offline actions. Many posts and discussions about feminist activities from Weibo, blogs, and WeChat public accounts were deleted by platforms. Most of the posts with feminist hashtag on Weibo have been deleted by the platform. The blog article that exposed sexual assault by Zhang Peng (a professor from Sun Yat-sen University) by an independent journalist and activist, Huang Xueqin, attracted wide attention and fostered an investigation by that university; but later, the article was deleted by the platform, Netease (Wang Yi). Responding to the censorship, activists adopted creative strategies to avoid censorship, including using different hashtags and emojis, and technical tricks.</p>

            <p>Despite activists’ resilience, the oppressive political power that the feminist movements faced was rather fierce and destructive. Professor Chang Jiang’s Weibo account was suspended for a month after he started the hashtag #I will be your voice#. A very influential independent feminist media in China, Feminist Voices, was forced to shut down in March 2018. Though it is hard to confirm whether Feminist Voices’ advocating of the #MeToo movement leads to its being shut down, the organization’s strong stance against patriarchy and support for feminist actions evidently make it susceptible to state surveillance and censorship. Feminist Voices’ Weibo and WeChat accounts, with 180,000 and 70,000 followers respectively, were permanently blocked by the two platforms with the justification "violating the related state’s policy and laws." This explanation given by the platforms is commonly used when any posts or accounts are deleted or suspended, and the platform censorship is enacted and legitimized by the state’s Internet censorship with a list of its Internet regulation policies.</p>

            <p>Because of the vague explanation offered by the platforms and little response from the government, it is unclear why some posts and accounts were censored while others still remain visible and accessible. But what is certain is that the feminist movements are neither welcomed nor supported by the state. In chairman Xi’s recent statement about women’s development in China, Party’s political power is highlighted: "under the Party’s leadership is of utmost importance to protect women’s rights and pursue gender equality". A statement, as such, indicates that any independent or bottom-up movements, protests, and actions are suspicious to the government as a potential threat to the Party’s political power. Although the majority of posts or actions rarely explicitly critique the state or cautiously avoid doing so, activities related to the  movement are constantly interrupted by the official powers, often at the local and municipal levels. Public feminist exhibitions in domestic cities were forcibly stopped and the activists had to find places in foreign countries. Students who organized collective action to demand that universities take action, such as publicizing the process and results of the investigation on professors’ accused sexual assault cases and launching policies to regulate teachers’ improper behavior and relationships with students, were interrogated by the universities and their requests were simply declined.</p>

        <section id="entrepreneurial-cfem">
            <h2>Entrepreneurial Feminism: Performing Sexuality For Economic Security</h2>
            
            <p>The most pronounced strand of Chinese feminism is called the "entrepreneurial" strand, for it encourages women to abandon traditional wifely duties such as submissiveness and self-sacrifice so they may exercise their autonomy on the marriage market to maximize their personal returns. Women’s leverage, or power, over men is therefore their own sexual attraction, including traditional femininity and domesticity, all of which are in the hands of women to cultivate and enhance. To best capitalize on this sexuality requires careful calculation and self-discipline.</p>

            <p>One extreme example of the entrepreneurial strand is the Zhai Xinxin incident, wherein the highly-calculating woman predator repeatedly extracted material benefits from heterosexual relationships, culminating in the death of a husband. Also illustrative of this strand is the reiteration of the "phoenix man" cautionary tale. A "phoenix man" refers to a man with a rural background who, like the legendary phoenix that once fledged in a modest nest, has managed to secure a white-collar job in the city. According to this entrepreneurial perspective, such a man is pernicious to his wife’s interests because his rural upbringing dictates him to drain his resources to supply his paternal family in the countryside. "Never marry a phoenix man" is a mantra that summarizes many online posts in which urban women who married men with rural origins detail their woes.</p>
       
            <p>Yet another manifestation of the entrepreneurial C-fem is its celebration of If You Are the One, a top-rated television dating show, for its refreshing presentation of woman’s power; on stage, women participants, always thin, fair-skinned, and eloquent, evaluate and choose bachelors. In the show’s most publicized episode, a "between-jobs" male contestant invited a female participant for a supposedly romantic ride on his bicycle, to which she responded: "I’d rather weep in a BMW." The entrepreneurial interpretation of these events centers on women’s "self-protection"—that is, women should not fall for "pure love."</p>

            <p>This strand has resonated with women’s anxiety and despair navigating the marriage market in China. Meanwhile, by heightening women’s economic stakes and exacerbating hidden class grievances, the entrepreneurial route to "woman’s empowerment" simultaneously corrodes intimate relationships.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes the entrepreneurial proposition is its emphasis on women’s individual agency and its blunt utilitarian view of marriage and heterosexual relationships in general. It is a woman herself, not her parents or any other authorities, who is responsible for the enterprise. Her ultimate goal is personal economic security, rather than the economic success or respectability of her family. This unsettles hegemonic family values and hence the stability of the marriage institution. However, by manipulating patriarchal norms for material gains, this strand enacts traditional patriarchal expectations of women and enhances hegemonic masculinity based on both economic and sexual dominance.</p>

            <h2>Marginalization of Disadvantaged Women</h2>

            <p>In facilitating the #Metoo movement in China, dozens of brave accusers, hundreds of feminist activists, scholars, and journalists, and thousands of concerned publics proactively participate in the online discussions and offline actions against sexual assault. The participants are predominantly elites, middle-class people, and feminist activists. The prominent visibility lies in the discourse of demanding justice to individuals among high-profile cases and contesting gender inequality.</p>

            <p>However, it is observed that both the radical and liberal perspectives in the deliberations and actions overlook the vulnerable conditions of the working-class and rural women. Among the subaltern women suffering from patriarchy, rural and working-class women are even more disadvantaged to the intersectional oppression of the capitalist market economy and urban privilege. Feminist sociological studies have exposed that rural-to-urban migrant women working in factories and households as maids encounter sexual harassment/assault on a routine basis. Rural women in China, among countless women living in rural areas worldwide, suffer from various forms of sexual violence. The lack of institutional support and economic, cultural, and social capital makes working-class and rural women even more vulnerable than urban middle-class women when facing sexual harassment.</p>
        
            <p>Capitalism and rural-urban dichotomy create distinctions between urban, middle-class women and their working-class and rural sisters. Yet, among the discussions of feminist movements on Weibo,Douban, and WeChat, issues about and voices of rural and working-class women are largely absent. There were few deliberations about the sexual violence that rural and working-class women very often face at home in rural villages and in their workplaces, such as urban households and factories.</p>

            <p>Such neglect of working-class and rural women is not only about the inclusiveness of China's feminist movements, but also critically relevant to the potential of feminist movements to mobilize the larger masses and pursue broader justice and equality against the interlocking systems of patriarchy, capitalism, and the rural-urban dichotomy in China.</p>

Other issues that merit further elaboration include: the suppression of feminist NGOs, which has pushed the movement toward digital platforms and led to its decentralization; the disconnect between different generations of feminists; and the reluctance of many young people to identify as or publicly voice themselves as feminists due to social pressures.</p>

                    <p>Chinese feminists navigate complex political limitations. Government censorship and surveillance have intensified, with feminist social media accounts and organizations frequently targeted. The balance between pushing for change and avoiding political red lines remains a constant challenge.</p>

                    <p>Government campaigns promoting traditional family values and encouraging women to marry and have more children create additional pressure against feminist advocacies. Media representations often reinforce traditional gender roles rather than challenging them.</p>

                    <p>Growing economic opportunities for educated women have provided a foundation for greater autonomy. China's high female labor force participation and women's increasing educational attainment create openings for challenging gender norms in both professional and personal spheres.</p>

                    <h3>Urban-Rural Divides</h3>
                    <p>Feminist discourse often remains concentrated among urban, educated women, with limited reach into rural areas where gender inequality may be more pronounced. Bridging these divides remains an ongoing challenge.</p>

                    <h3>Digital Platforms</h3>
                    <p>Despite censorship, digital spaces continue to provide critical venues for feminist discussion and organizing. New platforms and techniques emerge as others are shut down, demonstrating remarkable adaptability in maintaining feminist discourse.</p>
